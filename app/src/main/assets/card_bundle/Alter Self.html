            You assume a different form. When you cast the spell,
            choose one of the following options, the effects of which
            last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts,
            you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits
            of a different one.

            </p>

            Aquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an
            aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing
            webbing between your fingers. You can breathe
            underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your
            walking speed.

            <p>
            Change Appearance. You transform your appearance.

            </p>
            <p>
            You decide what you look like, including your height,
            weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length,
            coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can make yourself appear as a member of another
            race, though none of your statistics change. You also
            can't appear as a creature of a different size than you,
            and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal,
            you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for
            instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you
            can use your action to change your appearance in
            this way again.

            </p>

            Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines,
            horns, or a different natural w eapon of your choice. Your
            unarmed strikes deal <b>1d6 </b>bludgeoning, piercing, or
            slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon
            you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed
            strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you
            have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you
            make using it.
