            <p>
            After spending the casting time tracing magical
            pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge
            or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either
            no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The
            target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains
            the ability to speak one language you know. If the target
            is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots,
            vines, creepers, and soforth, and it gains senses similar
            to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate
            for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the
            awakened shrub or the awakened tree.

            </p>
            <p>
            The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for
            30 days or until you or your companions do anything
            harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends,
            the awakened creature chooses whether to remain
            friendly to you, based on how you treated it while
            it w as charmed.
