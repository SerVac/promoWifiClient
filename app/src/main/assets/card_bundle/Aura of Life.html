            Life-preserving energy radiates from you in an aura with
            a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves
            with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature
            in the aura (including you) has resistance to necrotic
            damage, and its hit point maximum can't be reduced. In
            addition, a nonhostile, living creature regains 1 hit point
            when it starts its turn in the aura with 0 hit points.
