            <p>
            A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds
            you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that
            suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't
            be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even m agic
            items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere
            moves with you, centered on you.

            </p>
            <p>
            Spells and other magical effects, except those created
            by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere
            and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast
            a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is
            suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends
            suppressed counts against its duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,
            such as magic missile and charm person, that target
            a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect
            on that target.

            </p>
            <p>
            Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical
            effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of
            the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

            </p>
            <p>
            For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are
            suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall
            if the overlap is large enough.

            </p>
            <p>
            Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a
            creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while
            the creature or object is in it.

            </p>
            <p>
            Magic Items. The properties and powers of
            magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For
            example, a + 1 longsword in the sphere functions as a
            nonmagical longsword.

            </p>
            <p>
            A magic weapon's properties and powers are
            suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
            wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic w eapon
            or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
            (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic
            spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the
            item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

            </p>
            <p>
            Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel
            fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the
            destination or the departure point for such magical
            travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of
            existence, as w ell as an opening to an extradimensional
            space such as that created by the rope trick spell,
            temporarily closes while in the sphere.

            </p>
            <p>
            Creatures and Objects. A creature or object
            summoned or created by m agic temporarily winks out
            of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly
            reappears once the space the creature occupied is no
            longer within the sphere.

            </p>
            <p>
            Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as
            dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the
            spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't
            nullify each other.
