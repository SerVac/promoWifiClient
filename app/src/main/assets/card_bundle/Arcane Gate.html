            You create linked teleportation portals that remain open
            for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that
            you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one
            point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet
            in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would
            open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,
            and the casting is lost.

            </p>

            The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings
            filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and
            perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is
            visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side
            that functions as a portal.

            </p>
            <p>
            Any creature or object entering the portal exits from
            the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each
            other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side
            has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque
            and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can
            rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side
            faces in a different direction.
