            You attempt to send one creature that you can see
            within range to another plane of existence. The
            target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw
            or be banished.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the target is native to the plane of existence you're
            on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane.

            </p>
            <p>
            While there, the target is incapacitated. The target
            remains there until the spell ends, at which point the
            target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest
            unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the target is native to a different plane of existence
            than the one you're on, the target is banished with
            a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the
            target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest
            unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise,
            the target doesn't return.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one
            additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
