            This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no
            harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range.

            It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is
            4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must
            succeed on a W isdom saving throw or be charmed
            by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your
            companions harms the target, the spells ends.
