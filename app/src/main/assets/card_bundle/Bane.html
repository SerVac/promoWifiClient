            Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see
            within range must make Charisma saving throws.

            </p>
            <p>
            Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes
            an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends,
            the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled
            from the attack roll or saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one
            additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
