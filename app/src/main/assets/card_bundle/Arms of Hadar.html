            <p>
            Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all
            creatures within 10 feet of you. Each creature in that
            area must m ake a Strength saving throw. On a failed
            save, a target takes <b>2d6 </b>necrotic damage and can't take
            reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the
            creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect.

            </p>

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d6 </b>for each slot level above 1st.
