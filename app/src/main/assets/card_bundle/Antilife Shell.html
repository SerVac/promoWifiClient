            A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot
            radius and moves with you, remaining centered on
            you and hedging out creatures other than undead and
            constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            The barrier prevents an affected creature from
            passing or reaching through. An affected creature
            can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach
            weapons through the barrier.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you move so that an affected creature is forced to
            pass through the barrier, the spell ends.
