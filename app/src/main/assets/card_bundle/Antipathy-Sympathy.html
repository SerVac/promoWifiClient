            This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice.

            </p>
            <p>
            You target something within range, either a Huge or
            smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger
            than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent
            creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.

            </p>
            <p>
            You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or
            repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose
            antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

            </p>
            <p>
            Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the
            kind you designated tofeel an intense urge to leave the
            area and avoid the target. When such a creature can
            see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature
            must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or b ecome
            frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can
            see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened
            by the target, the creature must use its movement to
            move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see
            the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from
            the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer
            frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if
            it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

            </p>
            <p>
            Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified
            creatures tofeel an intense urge to approach the target
            while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a
            creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it,
            the creature must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or
            use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area
            or move within reach of the target. When the creature
            has done so, it can't w illingly m ove away from the target.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected
            creature, the affected creature can make a W isdom
            saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

            </p>
            <p>
            Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its
            turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see
            it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
            successful save, the creature is no longer affected by
            the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or
            attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by
            the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every
            24 hours while the spell persists.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature that successfully saves against this effect
            is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be
            affected again.
