            You touch a w illing beast. For the duration of the spell,
            you can use your action to see through the beast's eyes
            and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until
            you use your action to return to your normal senses.

            </p>
            <p>
            While perceiving through the beast's senses, you gain
            the benefits of any special senses possessed by that
            creature, though you are blinded and deafened to your
            own surroundings.
