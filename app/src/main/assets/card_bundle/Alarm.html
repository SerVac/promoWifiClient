            You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose
            a door, a window, or an area within range that is no
            larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm
            alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches
            or enters the w arded area. When you cast the spell, you
            can designate creatures that w on't set off the alarm. You
            also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

            </p>

            A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind
            if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping
            awakens you if you are sleeping.

            </p>
            <p>
            An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell
            for 10 seconds within 60 feet.
